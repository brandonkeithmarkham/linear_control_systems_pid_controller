# Linear Control Systems Project

This repository contains the final report for my Linear Control Systems project, focusing on the design, tuning, and analysis of a PID controller.

## 📄 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to design a PID controller, tune it using the Ziegler–Nichols method, and analyze system performance through both MATLAB simulations and LTspice circuit models. Emphasis was placed on understanding the differences between theoretical models and real-world implementations.

## 🛠 Tools & Methods
- MATLAB (theoretical modeling & simulation)
- LTspice (circuit-level simulation)
- Routh-Hurwitz Stability Criterion
- Ziegler–Nichols PID Tuning Method

## 📊 Key Outcomes
- Achieved target overshoot specification
- Improved time-to-peak by over 90%
- Verified controller performance through simulation
- Analyzed discrepancies between mathematical models and practical circuits
