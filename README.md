# PID Controller Design Project

This project demonstrates the design and analysis of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller for a feedback control system, developed as part of my undergraduate Linear Control Systems course.

## 📋 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to design a PID controller to meet specific performance criteria provided by the course instructor. The controller was designed and tuned using a combination of:
- **LTspice simulations**
- **MATLAB analysis**
- **Theoretical calculations**
- **Second-order system approximations**

## ⚙️ Objectives
- Design a PID controller to meet designated performance specs (settling time, overshoot, stability).
- Validate the design through LTspice circuit simulation.
- Analyze system response and fine-tune controller gains using MATLAB tools.
- Apply classical control theory and second-order approximations for accurate tuning.

## 🛠 Tools & Methods
- **LTspice**: Circuit-level simulation of the PID implementation.
- **MATLAB Control Toolbox**: Frequency and time-domain analysis, gain tuning, step response.
- **Manual Calculations**: Root locus, Bode plot analysis, pole placement, and system approximations.

## 📂 Repository Structure





## 📊 Results
- Achieved desired system performance specs as per project requirements.
- Validated controller behavior through both simulation and theoretical analysis.
